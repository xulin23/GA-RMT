GA-RMT: Gaussian-Enhanced Retentive Memory Transformer for Thermal Infrared Small Target Tracking in Complex Backgrounds

In this paper, we propose a novel tracking framework, Gaussian-Enhanced Retentive Memory Transformer (GA-RMT), to address the challenges of small target tracking in thermal infrared (IR) imagery, including target size, unstable thermal response, and complex background interference. The GA-RMT incorporates a Retentive Memory Transformer (RMT) structure with a retention mechanism, replacing traditional self-attention to enhance long-term dependency modeling. This improves the model's ability to track small targets, especially in scenes with occlusion or cluttered backgrounds. Additionally, a Gaussian positional encoding mechanism is introduced to better capture the thermal response of target centers, enhancing tracking precision in IR images. To combat background interference, we propose the Frequency-Aware Foreground-Background Modulation (FAFM) mechanism, which utilizes wavelet decomposition to decompose frequency bands and modulates foreground and background energy distribution. This approach effectively suppresses background noise while enhancing target signals, improving detection and tracking accuracy, particularly in challenging IR environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the GA-RMT framework outperforms existing methods, especially in complex IR scenarios such as thermal cross-interference, dynamic backgrounds, and rapid occlusion/reappearance of targets. The proposed model achieves higher robustness and tracking precision, particularly in low-resolution, small target, and complex background settings.
